## ðŸ¤– My basic implementation of Llamaindex starter tutorials

1. This repo is primarily meant for educational purposes only
2. Most LLM calls are setup with GPT3.5 by default
3. Check rate limits for the provisioned OAI, AOAI resources to avoid API errors
4. Guidelines on data:
- Most data paths are self evident in the demo notebooks
- All required data are recommended to be housed in a data/ folder at the root level
